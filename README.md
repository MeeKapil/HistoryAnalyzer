# History Analyzer

A Python script to analyze shell command history, count occurrences of commands, and provide descriptions using the `whatis` command.

## Features
- Counts how many times each command was used.
- Retrieves descriptions of commands using `whatis`.
- Outputs the results to a formatted file (`history_analytics_rpt`).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/HistoryAnalyzer.git
   
How the Report is Useful:

The history analytics report provides a clear and concise summary of command usage with the following features:

    Command Frequency:
        The report shows how often each command has been executed, allowing you to quickly identify the most frequently used commands. This is valuable for automating repetitive tasks or focusing on optimizing specific operations.

    Command Descriptions:
        By including the description of each command from the whatis database, users can immediately understand the purpose and functionality of commands they may not be familiar with, leading to a more informed use of the terminal.

    Security Insights:
        The report can highlight the usage of administrative or potentially risky commands (e.g., sudo, rm, shutdown, etc.). This can be useful in a security context to understand what actions have been taken on the system and who performed them.

    Better Command Awareness:
        The report allows users to discover commands they have used less frequently, enabling them to explore new commands or better ways to accomplish tasks. It can act as a reflective tool to improve productivity.

    Efficiency in Scripting:
        If users frequently execute certain commands, the report can suggest opportunities to automate these tasks via custom scripts or aliases, saving time and reducing manual effort.

    Historical Context:
        By tracking what commands were run over time, the report provides valuable historical context. For instance, you might discover that a certain command was run many times just before a system issue, which could hint at potential causes.
